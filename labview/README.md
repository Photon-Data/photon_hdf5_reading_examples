This folder contains LabVIEW examples on reading Photon-HDF5 files.

The example VI is saved for LabVIEW 2012 on Windows.  Versions for previous versions can be attempted on request.

The VI requires installation of h5Labview (http://h5labview.sourceforge.net/) in order to provide the HDF5 functionality within LabVIEW.

The example uses version 2.11.2.137, which also requires installation of the HDF5 library v. 1.8.14 or newer from http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/

In order to get it to work, you may have to follow this advice from the h5labview website: "One you've installed HDF5, copy hdf5.dll, szip.dll and zlib.dll from the "bin" folder of the installation directory to LabVIEW's resource folder. This will ensure LabVIEW locates the correct version."
