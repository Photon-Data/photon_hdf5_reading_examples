This folder contains LabVIEW examples on reading Photon-HDF5 files.

The example VI is saved for LabVIEW 2012 on Windows.  Examples for previous versions can be attempted on request.

The VI requires prior installation of the free and open-source HDF5 LabVIEW API "h5Labview" (http://h5labview.sourceforge.net/) in order to provide the HDF5 functionality within LabVIEW.

The example uses version 2.11.2.137 of h5labview, which also requires prior installation of HDF5 library v. 1.8.14 or newer from http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/

In order to get it to work, you may have to follow this advice from the h5labview website: "Once you've installed HDF5, copy hdf5.dll, szip.dll and zlib.dll from the "bin" folder of the installation directory to LabVIEW's resource folder. This will ensure LabVIEW locates the correct version."
